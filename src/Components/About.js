          Science is inexplicably linked with our lives and helps us to understand the world around us better. It, thus, becomes imperative to encourage our students to think, learn, solve problems, and make informed decisions. The organization of the Science Exhibition is one such initiative. The activity aims to provide a platform for students to demonstrate such learnings that encourage the construction of knowledge by connecting new ideas to existing concepts as well as enriching oneâ€™s understanding of others' experiences and perspectives.
